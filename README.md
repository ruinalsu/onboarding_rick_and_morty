## Rick and Morty API mobile app MVP


### Business requirements:

1. User should have ability to download and install the app on a mobile device

2. User should have ability to view Rick and Morty characters with image and description

3. User should have ability to search characters by name

 

### Technical requirements:

1. List of characters should be presented as grid view with 2 columns

2. Search bar should be placed above list of characters

3. Search bar should contains a text input and a button

4. Search result should be updated by clicking the search button

5. Search bar should not scroll with list of characters

6. List of characters should preload 20 items and has a button with load more functionality on the bottom of the list

7. Concrete character item should contains image of character, name and status

 

### Use cases:

TBD

 

### UI/UX:

TBD

 

### Limitations:

Search suggestions, auto update search results and auto “load more” are out of scope of MVP

 

### Tasks:

1. Task - App skeleton (create project structure (surf_flutter_started) and setup)
Estimation: N/A (need surf_flutter_started script investigation) - 1 priority, Original Estimation: 1h

2. Service Task [SPIKE] - Top-level architecture development (DI, used packages, infrastructure and presentation layer communication)
Estimation: 1h - 1 priority

3. Task - Rick and Morty API integration
Estimation: 4h - 2 priority

4. Task - List of characters UI implementation (UI markup, presentation layer, bl)
Estimation: 4h - 2 priority

5. Task - Search bar UI implementation (UI markup, presentation layer, bl)
Estimation: 2h - 3 priority

6. Task [Improvement] - Load more implementation
Estimation: 1h - 4 priority


Tasks 4,5 can be splited on UI implementation and logic integration (if needed)

 
### Total Estimation: 13h (2 mandays)

 

### Risks:
surf_flutter_started - need usage investigation
